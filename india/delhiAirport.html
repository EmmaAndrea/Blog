            <p> 
                On the way home from Udaipur, I had quite the experience in the airports of India.
                Most notably was my experience in Delhi Airport. 
                I missed my connecting flight back to Ho Chi Minh City, mainly due to my flight from Udaipur to Delhi being delayed by two hours.
                I had no chance of catching the next flight, because it turns out Delhi Airport is so enormous you need to take a taxi from terminal 2 to terminal 3.
                I still tried, because I did not fully comprehend the impossibility of the transfer. This resulted in me getting stuck inside Delhi Airport.

                Despite not being in an official international transit, which would make it a normal scenario to be stuck in the airport while waiting for the next flight, since you may not actually have permission to enter the transit country, I needed military permission to leave the airport.
                In all the airports I experienced during my short visit to India, it was necessary to prove my flight booking in order to even enter the airport.
                In Udaipur, this was almost detrimental to my trip as I did not have a physical boarding pass. 
                I had not been able to print my booking confirmation nor had I been able to check-in, so all I had was a virtual booking confirmation.
                The guard at the entrance of the airport did not accept this as proof of my flight. 
                I had to get my friends (who were luckily on the same flight) to check me in at the self-service counters inside the airport and show the guard the printed boarding pass afterwards.
                As a frequent flyer, I rarely get nervous in or around airports, but this situation got my heart racing.
                It really seemed like a hopeless situation, the drive to the hotel would be too far to go print proof of my flight, and the guard offered no suggestins as to what was missing from my booking confirmation.
                I had no way to talk myself out of the situation, as the guard did not speak English, and I just felt entirely helpless.
